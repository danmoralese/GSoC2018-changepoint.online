### Background
Detecting changes in statistical properties of a time series is important in a large number of fields.  The original motivation for changepoint analysis was in sequential process control, where a decision as to whether a change has occurred must be made in real time.  With the increasing amount of sensor and similar online data, there is a clear need for online changepoint detection methods to be available through R packages.
